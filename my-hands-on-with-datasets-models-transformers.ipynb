Natural Language Processing with Transformers, Datasets, and SentencePiece\n","\n","## Overview\n","\n","This notebook demonstrates the use of state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools

We will leverage Hugging Face's `Transformers` and `Datasets` libraries alongside Google's `SentencePiece` for tokenization and text normalization.\n","\n","## Libraries and Tools\n","\n","### Transformers\n","\n","Developed by [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), the `Transformers` library provides a variety of pre-trained models that have revolutionized NLP. These models, such as BERT, GPT, and RoBERTa, are designed for tasks like:\n","\n","- Text classification\n","- Question answering\n","- Text generation\n","- Language translation\n","\n","Key features:\n","- Easy loading and fine-tuning of pre-trained models.\n","- Interfaces for both TensorFlow and PyTorch.\n","\n","### Datasets\n","\n","Also developed by [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), the `Datasets` library offers high-quality datasets for training and evaluating NLP models. It supports tasks including:\n","\n","- Text classification\n","- Named entity recognition (NER)\n","- Machine translation\n","\n","Key features:\n","- Unified interface for accessing and manipulating datasets.\n","- Functions for downloading, splitting, preprocessing, and loading datasets.\n","\n","### SentencePiece\n","\n","Developed by Google, `SentencePiece` is a tokenizer and text normalizer that segments text into subword units. This approach is particularly useful for handling out-of-vocabulary words and reducing vocabulary size.\n","\n","Key features:\n","- Uses a unigram language model to learn tokenization from text.\n","- Breaks new text into subwords based on learned patterns.\n","- Compatible with NLP frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.\n","\n","## Workflow\n","\n","1. **Loading Pre-trained Models and Datasets:**\n","   - Utilize the `Transformers` library to load state-of-the-art pre-trained models.\n","   - Access and manipulate datasets using the `Datasets` library.\n","\n","2. **Tokenization and Text Normalization:**\n","   - Apply `SentencePiece` for effective tokenization, which helps in managing out-of-vocabulary words and reduces the vocabulary size.\n","\n","3. **Fine-tuning and Evaluation:**\n","   - Fine-tune the pre-trained models on specific NLP tasks.\n","   - Evaluate model performance using the provided datasets.\n","\n","## Conclusion\n","\n","By integrating `Transformers`, `Datasets`, and `SentencePiece`, we can efficiently build and fine-tune robust NLP models capable of handling a variety of tasks.

This encoding typically involves mapping each token to its corresponding index in the model's vocabulary and converting the input sequence into numerical vectors.\n","\n","## **Model Inference:**\n","\n","The encoded input sequence is fed into the pre-trained transformer model. The model processes the input sequence through multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks to extract contextual representations of the text.\n","\n","## **Classification Head:**\n","\n","After processing the input text through the transformer layers, a classification head is attached to the model. This classification head consists of one or more dense layers that take the final contextual representation of the input text as input and produce predictions for the classification task.\n","\n","- For example, in binary classification tasks, the classification head may consist of a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function that outputs a probability score indicating the likelihood of the input text belonging to a particular class.\n","- In multi-class classification tasks, the classification head may consist of multiple neurons corresponding to each class, with a softmax activation function applied to produce a probability distribution over the classes.\n","\n","## **Prediction:**\n","\n","Finally, the model outputs the predicted class label or probability distribution over the classes for the input text.

This representation may look shorter compared to the original list, but in terms of memory or storage size, it may not necessarily be shorter.<br><br>\n","\n","- The primary benefit of serialization with bitsandbytes is not to make the data physically shorter but to convert it into a format that is easier to handle, transmit, or store, especially when dealing with complex data structures or when interoperating with other systems.<br><br>\n","\n","\n","\n","**Accelerate:**<br><br>\n","\n","- Suppose you're training a deep learning model to recognize images.

running your trained model to make predictions, accelerate helps make those predictions faster, which is crucial for real-time applications like video processing or natural language

BLEU considers the overlap of n-grams (contiguous sequences of n words) between the candidate and reference translations.\n","\n","      Precision calculation:\n","      For each n-gram size, BLEU calculates precision, which measures the proportion of n-grams in the candidate translation that appear in the reference translations.\n","\n","      Brevity penalty:\n","      BLEU also penalizes translations that are shorter than the reference translations to prevent shorter translations from receiving artificially high scores.\n","\n","      BLEU score:\n","      Finally, BLEU combines the precision scores for different n-gram sizes using a geometric mean and applies the brevity penalty to compute the overall BLEU score\n","\n","**Scoring range:**<br><br>\n","- BLEU scores range from 0 to 1, where a score closer to 1 indicates a better match between the machine-generated and human-translated texts.
